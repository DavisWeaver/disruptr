\title{function to calculate the network potential for each protein in a user-provided vector - cpp internal version}
\usage{
calc_np_all2(exp, g, v = as.character(names(igraph::V(g))))
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{expression vector - assumed to be a named vector where the values are expression and the names are the gene name}

\item{g}{igraph object - will be filtered so that only nodes found in both exp and g are kept}

\item{v}{character vector of nodes over which to calculate network potential.}
}
\value{
dataframe containing network potential for each of the inputed gene names.
}
